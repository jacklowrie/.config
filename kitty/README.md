# Kitty configs
[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is a terminal emulator for mac/linux.
- `kitty.conf` is the main config file. Look at [the docs](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/)
for config options. Don't forget to check the available
[kittens](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens_intro/) for more/easier options & changes.

## Changing app icon
[see the FAQ](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-do-not-like-the-kitty-icon) for
the full process and for some icon alternatives.

**tldr** if you put a `.icns` file in this directory and change the name
to `kitty.app.icns`, kitty will automatically use it everywhere on mac.
changing the name is key - all other `.icns` will be ignored. The other method
is brittle on mac.


## Ignored files
- `*.bak`: kitty makes backups of config when changed.
- `current-theme.conf`: this is generated by running `kitten themes`.
