# ZSH config files
[understanding zsh config files](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/zsh-configuration-files)

Even when setting `$ZDOTDIR`, zsh expects its config files to be dotfiles.
this is annoying, since that means everything in this directory is hidden.
Workaround: simlink dotfiles.

Notable exception: .p10k.zsh is generated by the p10k config wizard, so
no point renaming.
